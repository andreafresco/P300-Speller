# P300_Speller
The following code is realized by Fresco Andrea, Garza Roberto, Giove Morena, Losa Letizia and Molinari Giulia in the context of the "Neuroengineering" course, held by Cerveri Pietro and Pedrocchi Alessandra at Politecnico di Milano.

It consists of a machine learning algorithm to predict the letter thought by a subject given the EEG signal acquired during a letter selection task.

The aim of the code is to:
1) analyze the P300 speller dataset; 
2) extract EEG epochs from the EEG signals and filter them; 
3) Develop a neural network able to classify EEG epochs in two classes (P300 ‚Äê non-P300); 
4) detect the letters thought by the subjects during the test.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
