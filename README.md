# P300_Speller
The following code is realized by Fresco Andrea, Garza Roberto, Giove Morena, Losa Letizia and Molinari Giulia in the context of the "Neuroengineering" course, held by Cerveri Pietro and Pedrocchi Alessandra at Politecnico di Milano.

It consists of a machine learning algorithm to predict the letter thought by a subject given the EEG signal acquired during a letter selection task.

The aim of the code is to:
1) analyze the P300 speller dataset; 
2) extract EEG epochs from the EEG signals and filter them; 
3) Develop a neural network able to classify EEG epochs in two classes (P300 ‚Äê non-P300); 
4) detect the letters thought by the subjects during the test. 

The system has been developed using Colab by Google (https://colab.research.google.com).
